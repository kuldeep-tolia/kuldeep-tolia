- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kuldeep.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in developing numerical solvers for high-speed flows and heat transfer problems, as well as exploring high-performance computing.
- ðŸ‘€ My current research is focused around using the lattice Boltzmann method to study turbulent conjugate natural convection.
